    "\n",
    "The t-test and the z-test are both statistical hypothesis tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. However, they are applicable in different situations, primarily due to differences in assumptions and the type of data they are suitable for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Z-test:**\n",
    "The z-test is used when we know the population standard deviation or have a large sample size (typically n > 30). It assumes that the data follows a normal distribution and is more appropriate for cases where the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example scenario for a z-test:**\n",
    "Let's say you have data on the heights of adult males in a certain country and you want to test whether the average height of adult males in this country is significantly different from a known population mean height (e.g., the global average height of adult males). In this case, if you have a large enough sample size and the standard deviation of the population is known, you can use a z-test to perform the hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. T-test:**\n",

You divide the participants into two groups: a control group that receives a placebo and a treatment group that receives the new drug. After the study, you want to compare the mean reduction in blood pressure between the two groups. Since the population standard deviation is unknown, and you have a relatively small sample size, you would use a t-test to compare the means of the two groups and assess whether the drug has a statistically significant effect on blood pressure.\n",

    "In a one-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis (H1) is formulated to test for a specific direction of the effect. It checks whether the population parameter is either significantly greater than or significantly less than a certain value, but not both. Therefore, the critical region is concentrated in one tail of the sampling distribution.\n",

    "In a two-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis (H1) is formulated to test for a difference in either direction from the hypothesized value.

    "**Example Scenario for Type 1 Error:**\n",
    "Imagine a clinical drug trial where the null hypothesis (H0) states that the new drug has no effect on patients' recovery time. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the drug does have a significant effect, shortening the recovery time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 Error: The researchers mistakenly reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new drug has a significant effect on recovery time when, in reality, it does not. As a result, the drug might be approved for use, leading to unnecessary costs and potential side effects for patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Type 2 Error (False Negative):**\n",
    "A Type 2 error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. In other words, we miss detecting a significant effect or difference that exists in the population. This is akin to a \"missed opportunity\" to identify a real effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of committing a Type 2 error is denoted by the symbol beta (β). The power of a statistical test is equal to (1 - β) and represents the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n",

    "Continuing with the clinical drug trial example, suppose the null hypothesis (H0) is the same as before, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) still suggests that the drug has a significant effect, shortening recovery time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 Error: The researchers fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the new drug has no significant effect on recovery time, when, in reality, it does. As a result, an effective drug that could save lives and improve patient outcomes goes unnoticed and is not put into use.\n"

The formula for Bayes's theorem is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Prior Probability: The probability of a randomly selected person having the disease is 1% (or 0.01). So, $( P(\\text{Disease}) = 0.01 $).\n",
    "- Likelihood: The test has an accuracy of 95% in detecting the disease correctly (sensitivity). Therefore, the probability of a positive test result given that a person has the disease is 0.95, or $( P(\\text{Positive Test}|\\text{Disease}) = 0.95 $).\n",
    "- Complement of Likelihood: The test has a 5% false positive rate, meaning it indicates the disease incorrectly in 5% of healthy individuals (specificity). So, $( P(\\text{Positive Test}|\\text{No Disease}) = 0.05 $).\n",

    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is constructed based on sample data and is used to estimate the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides a measure of uncertainty about the population parameter and is often used in statistics to infer about the population mean, proportion, or other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are typically expressed with two values: a lower bound and an upper bound, which form a range. The confidence level associated with the interval represents the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter. For example, if we construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean, it means that there is a 95% probability that the true population mean falls within the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula to calculate a confidence interval depends on the parameter being estimated (mean, proportion, etc.) and the sample data's characteristics. The most common type of confidence interval is for estimating the population mean.\n",

    "The critical value is obtained from the standard normal distribution or the t-distribution based on the desired confidence level and the sample size. For larger sample sizes (usually n > 30), the critical value comes from the standard normal distribution (Z-score). For smaller sample sizes, the t-distribution is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Calculating a Confidence Interval:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a random sample of 50 students' test scores from a larger population. The sample mean is 78, and the sample standard deviation is 5. We want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean test score.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, find the critical value associated with a 95% confidence level for a sample size of 50. Since the sample size is relatively large, we can use the standard normal distribution. The critical value for a 95% confidence level is approximately 1.96.\n",

When conducting surveys or collecting data, it is often not feasible to collect data from an entire population, so we gather data from a sample and use it to make inferences about the whole population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error represents the range within which we expect the true population parameter to lie with a certain level of confidence. It is typically expressed as a percentage and is associated with a specific confidence level (e.g., 95% confidence level). The margin of error takes into account the variability in the sample data and provides an interval within which the population parameter is likely to be found.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say a political pollster wants to estimate the proportion of voters who support a particular candidate within a city. They conduct two surveys with different sample sizes and calculate the margin of error for each:\n",
