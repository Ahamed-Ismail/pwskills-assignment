    "## 1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python support Object Oriented Programming and is dynamically typed\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",

    "Extention for a python file is .py\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code is interpreted by python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function def\n",

    "## 8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. sys module: You can use the sys module to get information about the Python interpreter. The sys.version attribute returns the version number as a string.\n",
    "2. platform module: The platform module provides an API to get system-related information. The platform.python_version() function returns the version number as a string.\n",
    "3. Command-line argument: You can also use the command-line argument to get the version number. Open a terminal or command prompt and type python --version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "\n",
    "labmda function\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "\n",
    "PIP stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\". It is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install and manage third-party packages that are not part of the Python standard library. PIP makes it easy to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other repositories, and it automatically resolves dependencies between packages, ensuring that all required packages are installed correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. print(): used to print output to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. len(): used to get the length of an iterable such as a string, list, or tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. type(): used to get the type of a variable or expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. int(), float(), and str(): used to convert a value to an integer, float, or string type, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. input(): used to read user input from the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. range(): used to generate a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. max() and min(): used to find the maximum and minimum values in an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. sum(): used to find the sum of all elements in an iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier is technically not limited by the language specification itself. However, it is generally recommended to keep identifier names reasonably short and descriptive, typically no more than 79 characters, to improve readability and maintainability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn and read: Python has a simple and straightforward syntax that is easy to learn, read, and write. This makes it an ideal language for beginners and for rapid prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides many pre-built functions and modules that can be used for various tasks, such as working with files, network programming, and web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-platform compatibility: Python code can run on many different platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux, without requiring any changes to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third-party libraries: Python has a large and active community that has developed many third-party libraries and frameworks that can be used to build a wide range of applications, from scientific computing to web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic and flexible: Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that variables can change their type during runtime. This makes it very flexible and easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level language: Python is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away many low-level details and provides a simple and intuitive interface to complex operations. This makes it easy to write code that is both concise and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted language: Python is an interpreted language, which means that code can be executed immediately without the need to compile it first. This makes it easy to test and debug code, and allows for rapid development cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management in Python is handled by the Python interpreter and its underlying memory management system. Python uses automatic memory management, which means that the allocation and deallocation of memory is handled automatically by the interpreter, without the need for explicit memory management by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter uses a technique called reference counting to manage memory. Every object in Python has a reference count, which is the number of references to the object in the program. When an object is no longer referenced by any part of the program, its reference count drops to zero, and the interpreter automatically frees the memory associated with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Python installer from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Make sure to download the correct version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Python on your system. Make sure to select the \"Add Python to PATH\" option during the installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Python is installed, you can test it by opening a command prompt and typing \"python\" followed by the Enter key. This should launch the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you receive an error message indicating that \"python\" is not recognized as a command, you may need to add Python to your system's path variables. To do this, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Right-click on the \"Start\" button and select \"System\" from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Click on \"Advanced system settings\" in the left-hand pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Under \"System Variables\", scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable. Click on \"Edit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Click on \"New\" and add the path to the Python installation directory (e.g., \"C:\\Python38\"). Click \"OK\" to close all of the windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Close the command prompt and open a new one. Type \"python\" again to launch the Python interpreter. This time, it should launch without any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, indentation is required in Python. In fact, indentation is a fundamental part of the Python language syntax and is used to define the structure and hierarchy of code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, code blocks are defined by their indentation level, rather than by using explicit keywords like \"begin\" or \"end\". This means that the indentation of each line of code within a block must be consistent."
