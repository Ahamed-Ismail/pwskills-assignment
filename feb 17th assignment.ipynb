    "## Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database system that is designed to store and manage large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. It falls under the category of non-relational databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are database systems that are different from traditional SQL (relational) databases. Unlike SQL databases, which organize data into tables with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases use flexible data models that allow for the storage of various types of data, such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or time-series data. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is choosen when we need to store unstructured or semi structured data. It is used in certain domains such as IOTapplications and Web applications."

    "## Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MongoDB offers several features that make it a popular choice for developers and businesses. Here are some key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format known as BSON (Binary JSON). Documents are similar to JSON objects and can have varying structures, allowing developers to work with evolving and dynamic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability and High Availability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers or clusters. It supports automatic sharding, which enables data partitioning and distribution, resulting in improved scalability and performance. MongoDB also provides replica sets for high availability, ensuring data redundancy and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for the storage of diverse data types within a collection. Each document can have its own unique structure, enabling developers to work with data that can evolve over time without requiring a rigid schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Rich Query Language: MongoDB provides a powerful and expressive query language that allows for complex queries, filtering, sorting, and aggregation. It supports a wide range of query operators and provides indexing capabilities to optimize query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Indexing and Aggregation Framework: MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including single-field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes. Indexing can significantly improve query performance. Additionally, MongoDB offers an aggregation framework for performing complex data analysis and aggregations, allowing for real-time analytics on large datasets."
